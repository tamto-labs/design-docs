# Overview

The messaging system is built around a modular and extensible architecture, with primary support for pub/sub messaging patterns. The architecture consists of several key components, including a messaging broker, message producers and consumers, a Chord protocol implementation for distributed data management, an in-memory message storage system and an RBAC system for security and autorization.
