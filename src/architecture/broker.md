# Messaging Broker

The Messaging Broker acts as an intermediary between message producers and consumers, handling the routing and delivery of messages in the system. It is built on top of the Chord protocol, ensuring efficient distribution and scalability of messages across the network.

#### Message Reception and Routing

The broker receives incoming messages from producers via Cap'n'Proto streaming for persistent connections or Cap'n'Proto publish for one-off messages. Once a message is received, the broker routes it based on a subscription model. Consumers subscribe to specific topics and receive all messages published to those topics. Each consumer maintains an index to the last message it processed. This index handling allows multiple consumers to process all messages independently if desired, or share the index for exclusive processing where only one consumer receives each message.

#### Consumer Connection and Message Delivery

Depending on the number of consumers for a given topic, consumers can either connect directly to the node responsible for the topic (for less popular topics) or be evenly distributed across nodes (for more popular topics). Message distribution across the nodes is facilitated by the Chord finger table. In case a consumer is not available, it can fetch all messages from the last index after reconnecting, ensuring no messages are lost.

#### Message Storage

In the MVP stage, the broker will maintain all messages in memory, potentially shifting to a more persistent storage model later. Message retention time can be configured when creating a topic. Once the retention time passes, the message is removed from memory and can be retrieved from disk.

#### High-Throughput Scenarios and Scalability

For handling high-throughput scenarios, the broker can utilize partitioning to distribute the topic across the cluster. If there are many consumers, the topic could be replicated and utilize the Chord finger table to distribute messages. The broker is designed to support scalability with all communication between nodes based on the Chord protocol.

#### Error Handling and Security

To handle error situations such as network failures or system crashes, the broker will have replication mechanisms to maintain multiple copies of data within the cluster. Both global replication and topic-specific replication configurations will be used.

The broker ensures the security and privacy of messages by using RBAC for authorizing consumers and TLS for secure communication between nodes, consumers, and producers.

#### Extensibility

The broker is designed to be extensible, allowing additional features or components to be added without disrupting its core functionality. The specifics of this feature will be determined as the system evolves.

In summary, the Messaging Broker is a vital component of the system, responsible for efficient message routing and delivery, supporting system scalability, and ensuring the security and integrity of the messages.
